The g-drive link below pretaining contains the code for fullstack(GUI/Frontend) as well as a csv file used in eda_graphs.py file. This is part of my contribution to the project:

I contributed through:
1.	Carrying out initial cleaning for the data.
2.	Doing further cleaning and constructing models using xgboost and kNN to predict crimes. They yeiled low accuracy. However if I included the column which indentified the class of crimes, the accuracy increased by 20% on average for both models. We thought that using that column might be considered data-leakage.
3. Created the graphs used in the eda portion of the report and fullstack.
4.	I built the GUI or fullstack code using streamlit library.
5.	Contributed a little to the report
