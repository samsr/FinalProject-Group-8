Intro to Data Mining Final Project for Sam, Omar, Sertan

The code for fullstack(GUI/Frontend) and the original data csv file used for some of the EDA plots are stored in the link g-drive link below pretaining to Omar's gwu google account- the code presented there is part of Omar's contribution to the project:

The zip file "df_2019-2020.zip" contains the dataset we used. Each model independently cleans the base dataset for the particular model's application. Unzip the file, include it in the directory where you are running the mdoel, and then open and run the py file.

For the Decision Tree Model, when the code is run with the unzipped df_2019-2020.zip csv file, it will clean it and then create three models. There are options to export sav files of the models, or csv files for the train/test data, which was fed into the app.
